# PyAirTools-list
A curated list of Python libraries and tools that are useful for air quality and meteorology work. This list was created with the intent of helping my colleagues migrating from R, SAS, etc. to Python, but is left public in case it proves helpful to others.

[You can see the list here.](https://github.com/Zelpuz/PyAirTools-list/blob/main/the-list.md)

This collection differs from other good lists like [this one](https://github.com/ml-tooling/best-of-ml-python) in a few ways. Mainly, I try to be concise in what gets included but verbose in my comments. I deliberately do not include every possible library that might prove useful. I believe conciseness has value, and new users might be paralyzed with choice if they are simply provided with a long list; conversely, by describing what each library does and where it might be useful, users can be informed on where they might want to start. Also, my intent is to help researchers working in the fields of air quality, meteorology, and AQ-related epidemiology, so my choice of what is included in the list and my comments stem from that motivation.
